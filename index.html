    <p>I am just getting started at publishing stuff here.</p>
    <p>My github username is 980f, the product name of the first major engineering project I worked on, and a bit of a nightmare. It was to be the 3rd generation of a T.I. minicomputer whose main uses were seismic data acquisition and doing I/O management for T.I.'s little known supercomputer. That supercomputer was faster than a Cray I and was produced years before that, but took a staff of ~12 experienced techs to keep it running. Every time it lost power IC's would pop off of the boards due to thermal stress. It was built from ECL 3 input nand gates and 256x1 static rams. It was close enough in architecture to an IBM 360 to run code written for it.</p>
    <p>The 980F was to be a new generation of a minicomputer that had about twice the DMA performance of a VAX but only a 16-bit address space. The performance spec was to speed it up by a factor of 4, which we did even though we ended up running it at the same speed as its predecessor, 4 MHz. The speed up came from a faster memory system, that was double wide (designed to be field upgraded to a 32 bit CPU), and pipelining that the prior systems had not attempted. There were multiple ALU's, run in parallel with the instruction decoder doing a late decision as to which to pay attention to. One wrong decision by my boss cost us enough time to be too late to market to sell any, the marketing guys had overestimated the resistance of customers to migrating to other systems.<br>
